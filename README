Pipette is an very lightweight fluent API for defining single-threaded work pipelines.  It is designed to be used in batch processing scenarios, where a number of work items must feed through several steps of transformations or operations, with failures not stopping processing.


Right now the code is very minimal, and not fully tested.  My next piece of work will be adding unit tests and comments to cover the existing behavior.  Following that, I have some changes and expansions I want to make.
